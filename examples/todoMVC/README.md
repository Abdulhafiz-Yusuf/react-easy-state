# TodoMVC

**[Live Demo](https://solkimicreb.github.io/react-easy-state/examples/todoMVC/)**

This is a lighter version of the well-known React [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/). It separates the state into its own file and relies heavily on JS getters and setter to provide a clear and simple state management. Be sure to click all the buttons in the demo that you can find.
